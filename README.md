# icub-models

Repository containing models generated by https://github.com/robotology-playground/icub-model-generator .

## Usage

The model in the repo can be used either directly from the repo, or by installing them.
While the files can be used directly by pointing your software to their location, they are
tipically used by software that uses either YARP or ROS. For this reason, the models
are installed as part of the `iCub` ROS package following the instructions in
https://github.com/gerkey/ros1_external_use#installing-for-use-by-tools-like-roslaunch
and following the YARP guidelines on installing configuration files in http://www.yarp.it/yarp_data_dirs.html .
To make sure that this models are found by the software even when they are not installed in
system directories, tipically the [`YARP_DATA_DIRS`](http://www.yarp.it/yarp_data_dirs.html) and the
[`ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/EnvironmentVariables#ROS_PACKAGE_PATH) enviromental variables are modified appropriatly.


### From the source repo

In the case models are used from the repo, the first step is configure it with the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

If `<icub-models>` is the location of the repo, then `<icub-models>/build/iCub` needs to be appened to the `YARP_DATA_DIRS` env variable and `<icub-models>/build` needs to be appended to `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` env variable. On *nix system, this can be achived by adding to the `.bashrc` or equivalent file the following two lines:

```
export YARP_DATA_DIRS=${YARP_DATA_DIRS}:<icub-models>/build/iCub
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:<icub-models>/build/
```

### By installing the models

To install the models, from the `build` directory execute:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

Once you installed to a given prefix, you can modify the `YARP_DATA_DIRS` and `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` enviromental variables as in the following:

```
export YARP_DATA_DIRS=${YARP_DATA_DIRS}:<prefix>/share/iCub
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:<prefix>
```
